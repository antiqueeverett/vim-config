#### Recommendation

Each plugin may have dependencies which you may not have. I recommend disabling
the plugins entirely, and re-enabling them one at a time; that is to say

[comment out plugin
source](https://github.com/edisonslightbulbs/vim-dotfiles/blob/c2364263bfc56e8143a721c4ec2e74e75f645592/config.vim#L124)
```vim
" execute 'source $VIM_DOTFILES_PATH/plugin-config/' . file
```

#### Invitation to connect

Open to discuss about how to configure, optimize, and tweak day-to-day use of tools like **vim** and **git**?
let's get into it on [`twitter`](https://twitter.com/antiqueeverett) and on [`youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKkeK-xQiIWc3jzBbUel9ww?view_as=subscriber).

###### Caveat: This project has a life of its own, as such, jigs shared here are subject to tweaking.
