# NOTHING BUT PURE VIM GOODNESS!

#### Usage

1. In your `.vimrc` simply add:
```
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/settings/settings.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/plugins.vim
```

I keep all my dotfiles under `$HOME/Repositories/dotfiles/`.
If you have a similar repo naming convention, these dotfiles will work out-of-the-box.
If not, be sure to change the relative paths: ` see steps (2 & 3)`

```
source ~/Repositories/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/settings/settings.vim
source ~/Repositories/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/plugins.vim
```


2. in [ settings.vim ](https://github.com/edisonslightbulbs/vim-dotfiles/blob/master/settings/settings.vim)
```
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/settings/keybinds.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/settings/functions.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/settings/autocommands.vim
```

3. in [ plugins/plugins.vim ](https://github.com/edisonslightbulbs/vim-dotfiles/blob/master/plugins/plugins.vim)
```
" -- Plugin settings organized in exclusive files
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/fzf.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/nord.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/repeat.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/airline.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/vimtext.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/gruvbox.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/neoclide.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/nerdtree.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/indentline.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/youcompleteme.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/vimautoformat.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/rainbowparenth.vim

source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/development/heist.vim
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/vim-dotfiles/plugins/development/refactor.vim
```

Why keep plugin configs in endless separate files? Vim goodness is all about growth, constant growth. Sometimes it can get hard to keep up with changes explicitly for specific plugins. With this dotfile-template, it becomes easier, much easier to keep up with ever-growing settings. If you can stomach multiple sources, you can enjoy basking in readable vim goodness.
